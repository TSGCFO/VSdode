# Django Model Constraints


   - Existing Django models are strictly read-only
   - No modifications allowed to:
     * Field additions or removals
     * Field type changes
     * Model relationships
     * Model meta options
   - When model changes are requested:
     a. Inform the user about the model constraint
     b. Ask: "Should we make an exception to the constraints in this case, or would you prefer an alternative approach?"
     c. Wait for user direction before proceeding
